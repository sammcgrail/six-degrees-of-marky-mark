# Six Degrees of Marky Mark

## About
A spin off of the popular six degrees of Kevin Bacon parlor game.

This is my first attempt at a shortest path algorithm. Supply marky-mark.rb with an actor's name and it will compute the distance (using movies as nodes) to a Mark Wahlberg film.
 
#Note: The algorithm uses a pre-defined database of movies, actors, and a joining table called "cast_members.csv" but it could be extended to a more comprehensive database.
